This research intends to build a strong prediction model of Walmart store sales using time series data and applying the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. It is important for Walmart to ensure that it forecasts its sales in order to control its stocks, determine whether there are certain months or quarter that generates high sales as well as to decide on the right strategies to adopt in its marketing campaigns. This research also ensures that historical sales data of 45 Walmart stores are systematically collected and preprocessed for time series analysis. Using EDA, the research reveals patterns, seasons, and factors that affect the sales in one firm. The appropriate SARIMA model is chosen from testing different configurations for making accurate forecasts. There is a validation of the forecasted results in order to measure the quality of the model, and where various measures show how well the model is in capturing sales. Besides the accuracy of sales forecast, this research provides applicable information for Walmartâ€™s operations strategy, allowing the retailer to better satisfy customer demands and make better decisions. The results highlight the usefulness of time series scheme in retail and show how apt SARIMA models could apprehend seasonality and other impactful variables in sales data.
